## Getting Started

This is a practice project app to design new cards for the game Dominion.

NOTE: I do not own Dominion!  I am using a game that I love to help me learn more about programming

ALSO NOTE: This is a practice project, and as such will contain comments/notes for my own knowledge. If I submit a finished/final version of this project, I will of course clean out my note-taking

## Setup

From your project directory, run the following:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec ruby server.rb -o 0.0.0.0
```

Then, in another terminal tab, run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Navigate to `localhost:4567`.

## To-Do:
ISSUES:
Verify Card Page is unnecessary now that there is a card preview on the form.

HOWEVER, the user needs to be sent from the Card Design form to the Display Deck page after clicking submit.  Right now the user is being alerted that their card has been submitted, but they are still left on the Design Form

CHANGES TO DESIGN FORM:
X  - DROP-DOWN
X    - card type (have options pull from dataset)

  - UP-AND-DOWN
    - +Actions
    - +Cards
    - +Buys
    - Cost

X  - PREVIEWS
X    - show what image the user has selected via Url
X    - MAYBE - instead of a preview page, the user could view the card immediately while they're designing it

CHANGES TO SCSS:
  - For Card display:
    - Change px to %

CHANGES TO DECK CONTAINER:
  - Clicking on a single card will take you to its page
      - Card's page will have its own route
      - Card's page will have a link to edit it
        - fetch specific card from json
        - function to remove old card and replace it

NEW THINGS TO LEAN:
 - Jest
    - learn and write tests
